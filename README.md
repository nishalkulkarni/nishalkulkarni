### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at VIT (Graduating on May, 2023), when I'm not swamped with academic work I like contributing to open source projects and working on some projects of my own.

In the past I've worked as a student developer at GNOME as part of Google Summer of Code 2021 and have continued contributing since, I like working on low-level projects related to operating systems and kernels. 

I also contribute to projects that are not hosted on GitHub 
* GNOME - https://gitlab.gnome.org/nishalkulkarni
* Freedesktop(uresourced) - https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/nishalkulkarni
